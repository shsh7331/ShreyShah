      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <p>This project we propose is to create a phone app for Windfall Power for the NauticCharge hybrid supercapacitor battery. This project will be broken into diJerent sprints to provide realist timelines and trackable metrics. Using the above methods will expand our professional skills in learning how to do app development following customer requirements, the skill set of writing the code, how to apply the agile method to set expectations for deliveries and product hand offs.</p>

            <p>Review the project idea that I had, validate with the professor that it meet the class requirements</p>
            <p>The results of the review was to scale it to an MVP limited on a single device (iPhone).</p>
            <p>This addjustment to the plan was to make it more relealist to be completed in time.</li
    
        <h3>Goals for This Week:</h3>
            <p>Start the research into the different methods to create the iPhone app.</p>

        <p> Nauti-charge Project  update: <\p>
        <p>Authors : Patrick Ridley & Shrey Shah</p>
        <p> What did you do last week? We were able to get the environment setup. We were able to setup the xcode to work and connect to git account. Decide if we would use the CU boulder git or better to register the org on git. We decided to go with Registration on Git since our project deals with real world work.</p>
        <p>What do you plan to do this week? For the first sprint, Pat plans to start with exploring Native react and Expo and i plan to explore the Swift UI. </p>
        <p>Are there any impediments in your way? We have multiple issues with current setup on xcode and integrating it with a shared git repo. </p>
        <p>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? Reflecting on the current work done, we think we could have evaluated our hardware requirements earlier and plan accordingly.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div id="week3" class="content">
        <p>What did you do last week? Watched a lot of videos for xcode front end development. Was able to accomplish sample pushes from the test environment from our local machine to GIT. Created app icon and and able to publish to simulators. We now have the framework for end to end environment setup which we can build upon in the future weeks. </p>
        <p>What do you plan to do this week? For the second sprint, would like to do a lots of hands on with swiftUI and by the end of the sprint, i would like to get the front end skeleton layout ready based on the lucid chart flow diagrams.  This layout will be used for a presentation to review with client windfall power for MVP.</p>
        <p>Are there any impediments in your way? We ran into a limitation with using work machine for react could not install additional libraries required without being deployed by out IT dept. This guided our selection to implementing SwiftUI. </p>
        <p>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? Reflecting on the current work done, we are at a point in planning where we can break into granular details on how we like the app to operate. Also we wish we could have spent more time documenting on the BMS operations from the integration prospective that were discussed. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="week4" class="content">
        <p>Last week i created my first webpage (https://shsh7331.github.io/ShreyShah/ ).  Also, built a splash page for the Nautic Charge app.</p> 
        <p>This week I plan to do a DashboardView swift file which is the landing page after the splash screen. </p>
        <p>No major issues to report.  This week i mainly spent time on building that webpage and updating the front-end for it.</p>
        <p>I should have created a rough design document for the wesite front-end. Doing this would have saved me a buch of time, i spent a lot of time in developer tools on the browser on how websites customize the frontend.  </p>
        </div>
        <div id="week5" class="content">
        <p>Last week, following the engineering flow diagram was able to create blank feature pages and a link to connect it back compatible with  multiple orientation (landscape, portrait) and modes (light, dark) and able to deploy the test app on actual device. We now have the actual app that launches with a splash screen and lands on the ContentView which is sequenced by myapp swift file. We also had a call with windfall and they gave us the freedom to develop a app based on our preferences and will get a chance to demo it to them in the future.</p>
        <p>This week, I plan on developing the shop page feature which is the 2nd displayed feature in the HStack on the ContentView page.</p>
        <p>Last week, also spent a lot of time on watching videos and educating myself with how to structure the myapp so that future deployments can easily be integrated. This week I plan to further educate myself with front-end work on swift.</p>
